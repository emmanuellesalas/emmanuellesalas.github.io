    <p> &ensp; &ensp;These 4 inch cookies are the classic one! Why? Have you ever bit a cookie that is crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside? The saltyness and sweetness is a good combination. I'm telling you these cookies will give you goosebumps! Sugar, butter, flour, blocks of chocolate then it's ready to bake! <br><br> &ensp; &ensp; This photo was taken by my brother. We asked him to make a photoshoot of our products for advertising. He did great! </p>

    <p> &ensp; &ensp; These cookies are personally my favorite in our shop hehe. And these are our customer's top-picks too! Melted mallows are the one that makes the cookies more chewy! I also want it cooked toasted, originally s'mores are mallows on a stick that are cooked through fire. Mallows are a must snack in our night camp right? <br><br> &ensp; &ensp; I also enjoyed taking photos of these goodies and taking advantage of the morning sun. Cookies looked more detailed. Right? and also the grahan crumbs haha! </p>

    <p> &ensp; &ensp; Happy Birthday! These chunkie colorful cookies were launched last year on my sister's and mine's birthmonth, July! That's why these cookies are called <i> "birthday cookies"</i>. <br><br> &ensp; &ensp; Why is it chunkie? It has overload blocks of white chocs and mallows on the inside. Surprise! lol <br><br> &ensp; &ensp; These photo is one of our customer's order for her mom's birthday. Banner was customized based on the cutomer's like. Made by my sister.</p>

    <p> &ensp; &ensp; Another birthday cookie!!! Pastel Pink and a sneak peek of lilac butter cream on the other side. Just like the previous photo, these are also made with blocks of white chocolate, mallows and sprinkles molded in a cake pan. <br><br> &ensp; &ensp; These pieces were suggested by our friend "Abi" the name on the cake. She said she wanted the birthday cookie to be a cake. That's why my sister had an idea, why not put the cookie dough in cake pan, right? <br><br> &ensp; &ensp; This photo was taken in a gloomy day, we did had a hard time capturing it because we were then dependent in sunlight. </p>
