With its high location, you can enjoy the scenic view of Tagaytay as you enjoy the fresh breeze of air. This place was originally being developed way back in the 1980s’ by First lady Imelda Marcos but due to the end of Marcos regime, this place was not able to be fully finished as a mansion and eventually became a park open to the public. </p>
