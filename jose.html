My first visit at Jospehine's was long time ago. My children were still small that time and were with my in laws. This is my mom first time at Josephine's so I wanted it to be a memorable dining experience for her. Jospehine is located at the top of the ridge and has a spectacular view of Taal Volcano. The restaurant has floor to ceiling Windows and you may also choose to dine al fresco.
