<p> ○ MANILA TO TAGAYTAY BY VAN ○ 1.5 TO TWO HOURS TRAVEL TIME ○ FARE FROM PHP180.00 +/- <br>
Taking a van or FX is another alternative in going to Tagaytay. Although it is much more expensive than a bus, travel time is faster since it goes through SLEX and bypasses the traffic-ridden roads of Cavite. Its terminals are located at the EGI Mall near the LRT Gil Puyat Station [GPS MAP] (Taft Avenue cor. Buendia, 6:00am to 8:00pm), StarMall Mandaluyong [GPS MAP] (EDSA cor. Shaw Blvd.), Metropoint Mall at Edsa Rotunda [GPS MAP] and at the back of McDonald’s at the Edsa-Taft MRT Station [GPS MAP].

<p>Besides the San Agustin EDSA Rotunda terminal and the Nasugbu Terminal in Buendia, there are three other main public bus terminals in Metro Manila where you can catch a ride to Tagaytay. The first one, which has been closed previously, is the Park & Ride in Lawton, Manila [GPS MAP]. The second one is at the South West Integrated Provincial Transport Terminal in Uniwide Coastal Mall, Pasay City, this is a temporary terminal and would soon be closed by MMDA as they slowly transfer the service to the third place you can get a ride to Tagaytay, HK Sun Plaza [GPS MAP], which is also in Pasay City.
