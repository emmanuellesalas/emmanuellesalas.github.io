<p id= "cap"> My travels made me realize that some of finer restaurants were not in cities, but in quite rural settings. These idyllic surroundings not only served as a beautiful backdrop for any meal, but they were also a source of inspiration for my gastronomic dreams. I wanted to recreate that vision back home. Thus, the idea for Antonio’s was born.
Starting with the very best ingredients, we make dishes that inspire a sense of satisfaction and awe. While what is served on the plate should be the focus, we know that the experience is more than just the cuisine. From the crafted interiors and vistas to warm, gracious service, every detail, no matter how minute, is essential.
Antonio’s is our home, and you are our most honored guests.
